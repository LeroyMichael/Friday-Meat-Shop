# Friday-Meat-Shop
This project was originally created to solve my friend's business problem because he was overwhelmed by the large number of orders that had to be reported to his employees.<br>
This code detect a selected orders on the Tokopedia website and forward messages to WhatsApp using a chrome extension.<br>
But this code doesn't work because I'm having some problems retrieving data from Tokopedia and need help in resolving the problem.
# Project Problem
* Can't get data from a specific object
I'm using this code to extract data from a button.<br>
document.querySelector('.css-7ckp8u-unf-chip e181j6nn3').addEventListener('click', btnclicked); <br>
Error Message: <br>
analytics.js:37 POST https://stats.g.doubleclick.net/j/collect?t=dc&aip=1&_r=3&v=1&_v=j86&tid=UA-9801603-1&cid=663099785.1584618169&jid=1008110770&uid=17589476&gjid=1114853147&_gid=147120613.1601265920&_u=SCEAAEABAAAAAG~&z=1757786924 net::ERR_UNSAFE_REDIRECT
<br>
My guess is maybe this happened because Tokopedia prevented the data collection.<br>
